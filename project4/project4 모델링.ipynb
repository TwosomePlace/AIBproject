            This game surely overstayed its welcome - it was fun at start, became less interesting over time and turned into a chore by the end of the campaign. The story isn't bad, but it's kind of unremarkable. The freshness of playing a new character sometimes lasted for a while, other times disappeared within a couple of missions.  Oh, and I hated every single scenario that contained swarms of puny enemies. Moving and \"rolling\" attacks for every one of them sucked out the fun of the game for the whole group.   \n","271930                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Gloomhaven is D&D for eurogamers; it has slow incremental growth, character customization, and of course skull smashing. And Gloomhaven ports a lot of this quite well. The characters are unique and inviting, the world is evocative and new, and the card powers are fun from the start and only grow stronger with time. Most notable is the action selection mechanism which feeds into a palpable feeling of stamina drain as cards slowly leak out your deck and the scenario creeps to its conclusion. The problem is that Gloomhaven isn't fun. Despite all of its strengths, Gloomhaven is an overly protracted slog with unrelenting bookkeeping. I am a fan of heavy euros, but never has a game felt as laborious or as tedious as Gloomhaven. Even with my  friend who'd setup the games in advance, and automate enemy damage/effect tracking, the game felt horribly burdensome. After six scenarios we called it quits and returned to the plethora of other games that bring us joy.   \n","271163  Gloomhaven was great at first. The character progression was fun, the scenarios were challenging, the card play was interesting. Quickly things went downhill.   The randomness of the card draws for damage continually felt punishing. The loss of a great turn due to a null damage draw was demoralizing because of how difficult it was to manage the hand of player cards (I began missing dice rolling immediately). The scenarios began way too hard and stayed way too hard to be fun for us. The setup and takedown were way too cumbersome (even with the Broken Token insert). The bookkeeping was tedious and fiddly.   The Monster AI rules were so difficult to keep straight I never felt confident we were playing the game correctly. Any game where fan-made flow charts are needed to get a grasp of the Monster AI rules is a huge negative. This is the major design flaw of the game in my opinion. If you browse the forums you'll constantly see many questions and contradictory answers regarding this aspect.  I was mostly excited to experience the progression of my character. Instead I experienced having to replay the same (90 minute plus long) scenarios over and over again to make any progress with the story arc.   In the end, I'd rather play Descent 2.0, Heroquest, or Dungeon World.   \n","267578                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I'll be honest... only played 2 games so far, but I don't get the hype. Yeah it's solid, but nothing more than that. Hugely overpriced in a way since it has genuinely *too much* content for a game this simplistic. UItimately it comes down to pretty low-tactics/no-strategy dungeon crawling, room spawns enemies, throw biggest attacks, mop up, next room. Repeat ~400 times and you're done with your campaign. I'd recommend pen&paper instead, even pretty mediocre RPGs do this better since it isn't the whole game there. It isn't bad though. It's just too long and way, way, way too samey and simplistic.   \n","202947                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I like the gameplay and the sense of progression in levelling your character. The world building, story and random encounters are also good and produce a fun, rich atmosphere.  I do however feel some things could have been done better. Standard scenario difficulty is high, to the point where you need to do some grinding to beat them. Also the exhaustion mechanic, while providing some interesting urgency to the game, adds yet another opportunity to fail a scenario.

And Gloomhaven ports a lot of this quite well. The characters are unique and inviting, the world is evocative and new, and the card powers are fun from the start and only grow stronger with time. Most notable is the action selection mechanism which feeds into a palpable feeling of stamina drain as cards slowly leak out your deck and the scenario creeps to its conclusion. The problem is that Gloomhaven isn't fun. Despite all of its strengths, Gloomhaven is an overly protracted slog with unrelenting bookkeeping. I am a fan of heavy euros, but never has a game felt as laborious or as tedious as Gloomhaven. Even with my  friend who'd setup the games in advance, and automate enemy damage/effect tracking, the game felt horribly burdensome. After six scenarios we called it quits and returned to the plethora of other games that bring us joy.</td>\n","      <td>Gloomhaven</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.127881</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>271163</th>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>Gloomhaven was great at first. The character progression was fun, the scenarios were challenging, the card play was interesting. Quickly things went downhill.   The randomness of the card draws for damage continually felt punishing. The loss of a great turn due to a null damage draw was demoralizing because of how difficult it was to manage the hand of player cards (I began missing dice rolling immediately). The scenarios began way too hard and stayed way too hard to be fun for us. The setup and takedown were way too cumbersome (even with the Broken Token insert). The bookkeeping was tedious and fiddly.   The Monster AI rules were so difficult to keep straight I never felt confident we were playing the game correctly. Any game where fan-made flow charts are needed to get a grasp of the Monster AI rules is a huge negative. This is the major design flaw of the game in my opinion. If you browse the forums you'll constantly see many questions and contradictory answers regarding this aspect.  I was mostly excited to experience the progression of my character. Instead I experienced having to replay the same (90 minute plus long) scenarios over and over again to make any progress with the story arc.

The tradeoff between strength and endurance make for a unique experience that I look forward to every week.  The class balancing mechanisms ensure that, over the course of the campaign, players have the opportunity to try a variety of play styles. Even a given class can shift between damage mitigation options, damage-dealing, and support roles depending on party compositions and personal mood. While there are certainly situations which make the play styles feel constricted, the strategy generally encourages creativity and rewards players for actively seeking ways to benefit from class synergies.  Difficulty is managed very poorly. Increasing monster stats feels un-interesting, but Gloomhaven is not a game that is fun to lose. The threat should be present, as easy sessions are also boring and slow/tedious, but actually losing is rarely a gratifying experience.   \"Kill all enemies\" scenarios can get monotonous, but they feel necessary to make the non-extermination scenarios more engaging. Within scenarios, the progression system encourages players to skirt the line of selfishness and group compassion, as loot cannot be shared or transferred and is necessary to increase character power.   \n","153135                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Set-up, bookkeeping & teardown is tedious.

Standard scenario difficulty is high, to the point where you need to do some grinding to beat them. Also the exhaustion mechanic, while providing some interesting urgency to the game, adds yet another opportunity to fail a scenario. Finally the scenario requirements are not well explained, especially considering that there are several subtilities you need to take into account.  I also feel the personal quests are highly unbalanced. Some taking as little as 3-4 plays while others take far, far longer.   \n","255474                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Played with family a bit but was better solo with 4 Got bored though half way through, story didn’t hold my attention, quite choppy, loads of side quests I didn’t even attempt.

The tradeoff between strength and endurance make for a unique experience that I look forward to every week.  The class balancing mechanisms ensure that, over the course of the campaign, players have the opportunity to try a variety of play styles. Even a given class can shift between damage mitigation options, damage-dealing, and support roles depending on party compositions and personal mood. While there are certainly situations which make the play styles feel constricted, the strategy generally encourages creativity and rewards players for actively seeking ways to benefit from class synergies.  Difficulty is managed very poorly. Increasing monster stats feels un-interesting, but Gloomhaven is not a game that is fun to lose. The threat should be present, as easy sessions are also boring and slow/tedious, but actually losing is rarely a gratifying experience.   \"Kill all enemies\" scenarios can get monotonous, but they feel necessary to make the non-extermination scenarios more engaging. Within scenarios, the progression system encourages players to skirt the line of selfishness and group compassion, as loot cannot be shared or transferred and is necessary to increase character power.</td>\n","      <td>Gloomhaven</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.186248</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>153135</th>\n","      <td>9.5</td>\n","      <td>Set-up, bookkeeping &amp; teardown is tedious.
